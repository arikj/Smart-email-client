Hi All,

Day 1 of Inferno '13 started offbeat but ended in a great fashion. The
sporting spirit among the players was sky high.

There were some quite interesting and close matches witnessed today.

In Badminton, Kartik from Marathas snatched the victory from the hands of
Rochak from Rajputs after lagging 13-18 in the final set.

In Volleyball, Sandilya single handedly took Rajputs over the line in a
close match against Mauryans. Rajputs took the 1st set after lagging 13-19
and then Maruyans equalized the score by winning the 2nd set. But Rajputs
were just a bit better and saw themselves beyond the finishing line.

Cheers,
Inferno Coordinators
