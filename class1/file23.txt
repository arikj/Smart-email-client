Hi,

Once again outdoor sports could not be conducted due to rains. They will be
scheduled probably for next weekend or whenever possible.
Sports like TT, Badminton and Squash were smoothly conducted and finished on
time. Thanks to the event coordinators for their dedication in making these
events successful.

In TT, our President Mr. Himanshu Pandey grabbed the 1st position and led
his pool to victory, beating almost all his opponents comfortably.

In Badminton, the captain Maitrey Verma took the 1st spot in both singles
and doubles. He played 2 doubles and 3 singles matches back to back and won
all of them and proved his class. In singles finals, Rohit (freshman) gave
him a tough competition and showed that he has a great future ahead.

In Squash, Ishan came on the top of podium beating Pranjal Garg.

In Aquatics, Vasu won 3 races out of 4 and in Water Polo, Rajputs were clear
winners.

Detailed results of day 4 can be seen on : http://goo.gl/CFtVhI

Cheers,
Inferno Coordinators

P.S: A special mention for the Hall-7 sport secretary Mayank Gangwar who has
participated in 3 sports: TT, Badminton, Water Polo and has led his hall
really well.
