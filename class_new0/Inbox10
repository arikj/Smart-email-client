Question: How did Ashton Kutcher prepare for his role as Steve Jobs in the =
new movie Jobs?

Answer from Ashton Kutcher
I spent about 3 months preparing the character.

I started by consuming content about Steve Jobs. The script was a fantastic=
 resource but after reading it I was left with as many questions as answers=
 as to why he was the way he was and why he made some of the decisions he m=
ade.  I started by watching documentaries and interviews Silicon Valley His=
torical Association [ http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/#!steve-jobs-f=

nology [ https://flipboard.com/section/inspired-by-

Post from Ruchit Doshi
A teacher teaching Maths to seven-year-old Arnav asked him, "If I give you
one apple and one apple and one apple, how many apples will you have?
"Within a few seconds Arnav replied confidently, "Four!"

The dismayed teacher was expecting an effortless correct answer (three).
She was disappointed.  "Maybe the child did not listen properly," she
thought.  She repeated, "Arnav, listen carefully..  If I give you one
apple and one apple and one apple, how many apples will you have?"

Arnav had seen the disappointment on his teacher's face.  He calcu

Question: Why doesn't Batman just kill The Joker [ http://www.quora.com/The=
-Joker-Batman-character ]?
Rachit Tripathi voted up this answer.
Answer from Jesse Richards
Because the Joker wins if Batman kills him. That's what the Joker wants. Ev=
erything he does is to taunt Batman into killing him. In fact, the interest=
ing part of their relationship, the real conflict of each story, is not to =
see if Batman will stop him (he will), but to watch Batman struggle with no=
t killing him, because anyone other than Batman would of course kill him. T=
his self-control is Batman's superpower.=20=20

One very good candidate, according to Tony Hoare (developer of quicksort [ =

Question: Why is Pratibha Patil widely hated & disrespected?

Answer from Balaji Viswanathan
1. Ms. Patil used Indian government's money to take useless foreign trips w=
ith her grandchildren. When they are on travel, Presidents are supposed to =
meet foreign dignitaries and improve diplomatic relationships & cultural ex=
change. In her foreign trips, her huge extended family travels at taxpayer'=
s expense to touristy spots. 22 trips and $40 million in travel expenses.=

United refers to their outside-in boarding process as "WilMA" (Window, Midd=
le, Aisle).
United boards Mileage Plus Premier, Mileage Plus Premier Associate, Mileage=

e clogging in the aisles.
