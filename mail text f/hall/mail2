Hi all,
This is to inform all the Y11 junta of hall 5 that they will all be
getting single rooms next semester onwards.
There is an issue with the distribution of the wings, as you all know our
first year wings consisted of 34 members each, but each wing has the
capacity of 18 members(if single rooms given), so the Y11 wings will be
divided as 18+16. This division also has an issue as our strength is 299,
so by going on with the 18+16 distribution we will be accommodated in 17
wings(we were 9 wings in first year). Thus, we have came up with 2
solutions for this, on the basis of majority voting we will finalize the
process of allocation.
The two solutions are-
1. 1 wing from the 9 wings(as based on 1st year wings) will be divided
into 16+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+4,i.e., will be distributed among the 9 different
wings. This wing will be decided on a lottery that will be conducted
during the summers and each wing will have to send their representative.

2. Random allocation : Everyone will be informed about the wings that will
be occupied by the Y11 batch, you will decide which wing and room you want
to take, this will give you an option of forming your own new wing , as
you all can decide and come together to the campus on the same time and
take your rooms.

Please vote, the majority voting will decide the process of wing
allocation for Y11 batch in Hall 5. Voting is anonymous. for voting go to
the link below, Votes till 24th May,11:59 p.m. will be considered :

P.S. : Whichever be the process, the rooms will be given on first come
first serve basis, one person can take only one room, I Cards will be
checked by the hall office staff while giving the rooms. The rooms will be
given after 15th july, so you can make your reservations accordingly.
