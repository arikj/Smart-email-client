Hi,
After the joy and thrill of Toy Car Workshop, we move forward with our
Lecture Series for Takneek. We begin with our first lecture on "Sensors
and Micro-controllers" which will be a major part of The Takneek Problem
Statement and all your future engagements with Robotics. We will be
covering things from scratch so you should not worry if you have not
attended the
Introductory Lecture or workshop.

Details of the first lecture are as follows:

Venue: L7
Date: 18-Aug-2013
Time: 6PM to 8PM
Topic: Sensors and Micro-Controllers

Please note that this lecture is open to all and branch independent.
Hoping for an enthusiastic response!!!

Cheers!!
