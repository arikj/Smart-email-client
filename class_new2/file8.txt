Hi everyone!

Have you ever looked up at the sky in amazement and wondered and awed at
it's beauty? Did you ever want to have a closer look at it? Have you ever
looked at amazing telescopes and related equipment and wondered how to use
them?

The astronomy club presents to you the Hall level Telescope handling

We'll still get a chance to talk about some basic telescope handling and
astronomy.
