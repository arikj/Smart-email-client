Hi everyone!

Have you ever looked up at the sky in amazement and wondered and awed at
it's beauty? Did you ever want to have a closer look at it? Have you ever
looked at amazing telescopes and related equipment and wondered how to use
them?

The astronomy club presents to you the Hall level Telescope handling
sessions!
Tomorrow, on the 16th of August, we will be coming to Hall 3 and Hall 7 to
teach you all how to use a telescope and a little about other basic
astronomy. Please do come even if there are clouds. We'll still get a
chance to talk about some basic telescope handling and astronomy.

Time and venues:
16th August

8:30pm to 10:00pm

Hall 3 :- At the lawns near the main hall gate

10:30pm to 12:00am

Hall 7 :- Open area near Hall gate

People from other halls need not worry! One by one we'll be coming to all
other halls too!

Hope to see you all in large numbers!


May the clear skies be with you!
Cheers,
Coordinators,
Astronomy Club
