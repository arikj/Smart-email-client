Hi,

Has it ever happened that you look at a structure and thought, 'How is
this thing staying up?' , 'How are the joints made ?', 'How does this
structure balance the weight?', 'How will it perform in case of
disasters?' etc.

Then DesCon is the right place for you to be. Design and Construction
Hobby Group (DesCon) aims to provide a platform to people oriented towards
structural designing, load distribution, disaster proof structuring,
aesthetics of structural designing, etc.

To begin this journey , DesCon is organizing its Introductory Lecture on
16 August.

Date: 16 August
Time: 7:45 pm
Venue: L2

Kindly be on time and try to bring a pencil and copy with you.

Thanking You
DesCon
