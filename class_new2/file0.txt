Hello all

As part of the summer project under Programming Club we have developed an
android app "Academic Planner" which manages our academic data and hope so
it will be useful for you also.

Link to download the apk file is :
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B46Ub1pRKtuBX1U2TmJDaXVtVkE/edit?pli=1

A brief description of the app :

The user can input course number of the courses and details of the course
like instructor name, instructor email id, course schedule, venue, etc.
are automatically fetched from OARS. Other course or instructor details
which are not provided by OARS can be manually entered or edited by the
user.

When the user enters his/her roll no., the latest exam schedule on OARS is
automatically fetched and is also synced with the phone's calendar.

Course weblink can be clicked to open the webpage and instructor's email
id can be clicked to launch email application from the course display
page.

There is also a notes tab where different notes can be added and can serve
as android sticky notes.

It automatically creates a weekly schedule(timetable) for all the added
courses clearly stating the lab, lecture and tutorial.

PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO IITK WIFI NETWORK ON NO-PROXY
WHILE ADDING THE COURSES AND EXAM SCHEDULE(if you dont know how to do it
follow this link http://goo.gl/2SOick ) .

For more details regarding the app, please read the "ABOUT APP" page in
the Menu option of the app.
