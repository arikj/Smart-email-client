Hi,
The Deadline is extended to MIDNIGHT, 18th August.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Students,

If you think getting credit for what you have done goes farther than those
so called ‘TREATS’, you may go on reading this email.

If you think things can’t be done overnight (like publishing a magazine)
just because you are an IITian, then you are allowed to proceed.

Now, that you have cleared a few checkpoints, it is customary to give the
regular introduction to Scientia. Scientia is the annual Sci-tech magazine
of IIT Kanpur created by Science And Technology Council, and we think we
have said enough. For more blabber, see these links:

Le BLOG:        http://students.iitk.ac.in/snt/scientia/blog/
Le FB PAGE:     https://www.facebook.com/scientia.iitk

The point of haranguing you for so long is that we need people to THINK,
DESIGN, WRITE and EDIT.

APPLICATIONS are invited for the same (NO batch restrictions):

DEADLINE for applications is MIDNIGHT, 18th August.
Eligibility Criteria:- Cpi should be greater than 6.5

In case you thought this is more hype than substance, check out previous
year’s Scientia. Critical analysis of it would be appreciated.
