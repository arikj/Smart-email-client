Hi everyone!

For those of you who had come yesterday for our sessions, we apologize for
the disappointment due to the rains. But whether you came yesterday or
not, were back again...

Have you ever looked up at the sky in amazement and wondered and awed at
it's beauty? Did you ever want to have a closer look at it? Have you ever
looked at amazing telescopes and related equipment and wondered how to use
them?

The astronomy club presents to you the Hall level Telescope handling
sessions!
Tomorrow, on the 18th of August, we will be coming to Hall 2 and Hall 5 to
teach you all how to use a telescope and a little about other basic
astronomy. Please do come even if there are clouds. We'll still get a
chance to talk about some basic telescope handling and astronomy. If it's
raining though, then we might have a problem...

Time and venues:
18th August

10:30 pm to 12:00 am

Hall 2 :- At the basketball court
Hall 5 :- Lawns behind the hall buildings

If any of you missed out on any of our previous sessions, then feel free
to meet us at any of the above venues! And those in other halls need not
worry! We'll be coming soon to your hall too!

Hope to see you all in large numbers!


May the clear skies be with you!
Cheers,
Coordinators,
Astronomy Club
