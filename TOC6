What's Piazza?
Piazza is an online gathering place where students can ask, answer, and explore 24/7 under the guidance of their instructors, so you'll be able to get the answers you need fast. Thousands of classes are using Piazza, and the fastest has an average response time of 7 minutes! We notify your class when you're stuck or have a question, let you ask and answer questions anonymously, and support LaTeX and code formatting. There are even free iPhone and Android apps.
