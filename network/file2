Subject:TAs for the course
Body: I am happy to announce that the following two students of CSE
department will be the TAs in this course:

Pankaj More (pankajm@iitk.ac.in)
Era Jain (era@iitk.ac.in)

I am particularly happy about them being TAssince they did
a course on Advanced Networking in the previous semester,
and were the top two students in the course.

If you have any questions, problems with any component of
the course, feel free to contact them. Not only their
technical knowledge is very good, they also explain
things very well. We have been very fortunate to have
such TAs.

Best wishes,
