Subject:Course Notes
Body: Dear students:

As mentioned last week in the lecture, I would like to have
all lectures being transcribed, along with as much additional
information as possible. Additional information could be
pictures (with credits, of course), more information (again
with credits, if being reproduced verbatim from some source),
links to videos, simulations, animations, and so on.

As we also said, if someone (or a group of 2) does a good
job at this, one may get up to 3 percent of the course credit,
which will ensure that if you are a borderline case, you will
get the higher grade(and many students miss the higher grade
by up to 3 percent).

If you wish to transcribe a lecture, you may send your name
to one of the two TAs, whose names and email addresses
I just sent in the earlier mail.

Best wishes,

-dheeraj
