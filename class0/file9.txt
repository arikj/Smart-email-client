Hi All,

Nominations are called for the post of Executives, Video Team,
Antaragni'13.


Video coverage and releases is one of the top priorities of Antaragni. 
Hence the role of an Executive is very important.
The main responsibilities of the video team would be as follows:

(1)    Conceptualising and creating promotional videos for Antaragni as a
whole.

(2)    Assisting specific cells in making their own promotional videos.

(3)    Managing the video coverage  and distribution of content during the
festival.



Apart from basic creativity, the candidate is expected to be familiar with
video editing. Knowledge of After Effects will be an advantage but is not a
pre-requisite.

The nominations have to be filled in the following Google Form.
