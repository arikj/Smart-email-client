
Dear class:

I trust all of you have had a chance to meet and correct the
morphological segmentations.

I am expecting that each group SPELLING convenor will come up with a
list of about 50-100 spelling errors from the 1500 or so words that
each group has seen.  We will then merge these into a single list
to be used in the next homework.

For languages other than Hindi, I will ask each person to see if you
can come up with some spelling errors (it is not very useful to make
these up, since then you may not be following a good process model).

Re: the quiz, I will be posting the lecture notes by 8pm today.
The reading
material is mainly from chapters 2 and 3 and 5 (2000 ed) of
Jurafsky/Martin; however, we have not covered some topics
very deeply while some others we have looked at greater
depth.

AM
