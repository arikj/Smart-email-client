Adarsh I am a CSE student from 2nd year iitk. I did my summer project on  
kernel and linux development . Our project mainly aimed on system calls,  
and char drivers and user space too. I want your help in deciding what to  
do now.I am interested in taking a year long project in pclub. And I also  
want to continue with linux and kernel programming. Can you please give  
some ideas for it.
