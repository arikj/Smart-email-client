Active Discussion of the day

 * Ron Roehl started a discussion on a news article:
  Can Android display a Badge over an Application Icon, like on an iPhone o=
r iPad? (13)

  > @Jithin: The facebook icon that you see, with the number of
  > notifications is possible only because the Launcher treats Facebook and
  > a few other apps specially and the place where they display the icon is
  > not just an image view displaying the icon rather, it is a view
  > consisting of image view and text view combined. It is very easy to
  > verify the same. Connect the device on which you have this facebook ico=
n
  > to your computer, open the DDMS perspective in eclipse, from the left
  > pane select the device and click the icon of Dump View Hierarchy. This
  > will give you a screenshot of your device in eclipse in which you will
  > be able to select and see any screen areas view details. If you select
  > the facebook icon there, you will see what i described above.

 * Ashley Sinclair started a discussion on a news article:
  Apple and Android combine to make up 92% share of the smartphone market (=
4)

  > In my opinion to be accurate it is really Apple and Google (Android and

  > smooth with zero hick ups and again very very fast. We should start
  > comparing Apples to Apples by comparing Apple to Google and IOS to
  > Android, it's a lot more interesting that way.
