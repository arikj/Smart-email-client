Question: What is the best April fools prank ever?
Nitish Satyavolu voted up this answer.
Answer from Deepak Kumar Chichula
There was a man so dedicated to April Fools, he flew hundreds of tires into=
 a dormant volcano in Alaska and set them on fire. Fooling the local popula=
ce, and coast guard into thinking the volcano was active.

Residents of Sitka, Alaska woke on the morning of Monday April 1, 1974 to a=
 bright, clear day. They could see right across Sitka Sound to Kruzof Islan=
d, where the familiar sight of Mount Edgecumbe, a volcano dormant for 400 y=
ears, loomed. But today something was different about the view. A menacing =
plume of black smoke was rising from the=20

Yesterday, even I had gone to Himalaya Mall, and even I was charged 20 rupe=

GHANTA ENGINEERING: This girl is a keeper!

Post from Amit Jadhav
This girl is a keeper!!!!
It happened at a New York Airport. This is hilarious. I wish I had the guts=
 of this girl. An award should go to the United Airlines gate agent in New =
York for being smart and funny, while making her point, when confronted wit=
h a passenger who probably deserved to fly as cargo. For all of you out the=
re who have had to deal with an irate customer, this one is for you.

A crowded United Airlines flight was canceled. A single agent was re-bookin=
g a long line of inconvenienced travelers.

Suddenly, an angry passenger pushed

Question: What was the funniest (or) weirdest thing that happened to you wh=
ile travelling in a Delhi Metro rail?
Dipti Sharma voted up this answer.
Answer from Shaonli Nath
Well it happens everyday while I am returning from my office in Gurgaon to =
Delhi.=20
The moment train enters the underground tunnel after Qutb Minar station, ev=
ery girl in my compartment looks up and checks herself in the window (which=
 has turned into a mirror because of the darkness outside). The whole thing=
 is spontaneous, perfectly synchronized and independent of the rush.

Question: What is the truth about the nutrition of avocados?

Answer from Clinton Koch
I must say as a nutritionist, I really really dislike the top answer and th=
e fact that it was voted up. You will NEVER convince me that eating 1000 ca=
lories of twinkies is the same as fresh whole fruits and vegetables. His un=
derstanding of nutrition is way too simplified. Not to mention that his lon=
g winded post doesn't really even answer the question. Many studies have be=
en done recently on the avocado and it really IS a superfood of nutrition. =
Monosaturated fatty acids are being linked with a trimmer figure in many st=
udies. The biggest being=20

Answer from Nipun Kothare
Me  and my sister (aged 11 and 16 at that time ) argued for 43 minutes  aft=
er we both laid down on the bed as to who will get up & switch  off the lig=
ht. That duration also involved some light hearted slapping  & pushing the =
other person out of the bed .Yep we decided that its  only logical for the =
guy who does fall off to go and switch it off.=20

And  thats not it. We had to make a system out of this light switching off =

Google normally searches for pages that contain all the words you type in t=
