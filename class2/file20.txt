Hi all,

After the Lecture on Sensors, we move to Actuators (Motors,
Mechanisms, Processes and Concepts). This lecture will focus on the
mechanical aspects of 'Your Robot' which again will be a major part of your
Takneek Problem Statement - "Roboclub" and your favorite  "Wild Soccer".
This will be an independent lecture, so if you missed the last one on
Sensors - you can still catch up.

Details of the lecture are as follows:

Venue: L7
Date and Time: 19-Aug-2013
Time: 8PM to 9:30PM
Topic: Actuators

Cheers,
Coordinators
