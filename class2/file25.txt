More about us for the curious-

Science Coffeehouse is IIT Kanpur's Science Discussion group. We meet
once a week, gather around a white-board for discussions on different
topics for the sessions that may last anything from 2 to 6 hours (or
more!) depending upon how exciting the topic is to us. Whoever has read
about the topic leads the informal discussion. The best part: everyone
comes to the Science Coffeehouse session with an idea that they've read
about and goes back with 5 more ideas

If you've ever found yourself immersed in a book by Stephen Hawking,
Richard Dawkins or Richard Feynman; If you've ever found yourself deeply
engrossed in a discussion on a topic that a pedant would call Science;
If you've ever found yourself lost in questions of life, the universe
and everything; then, my friend, Science Coffeehouse is the place for
you!
