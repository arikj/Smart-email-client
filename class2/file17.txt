Hello Everyone,

Hope you all enjoyed the first two beginners method workshops and today's
2x2x2 workshop & Takneek's Lecture as well.
Here we come with another workshop in this series.

The schedule is as follows:

3x3x3 Intermediate Method Workshop
Date  : Aug 18 ( Sunday )
Time  : 3 PM to 6 PM
Venue : L16

Intermediate Method is an advanced level of Beginner's Method with a few
more tactics and algorithms in it. It may help you in improving your
solving time for world-wide cubing competitions considering upcoming
Takneek as well.

NOTE:
i) Those who DON'T know how to solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube can also attend
the workshop and there will be separate mentors to teach the beginners
method.
ii) Although we will try to provide cubes to everyone, but still if you
have a 3x3x3, then please bring it.

Hoping to see you all again soon !

Regards,
Coordinators,
Rubik's Cube Hobby Group
