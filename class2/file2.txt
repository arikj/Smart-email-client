Hey everyone!

With everyone beginning to gear up for Takneek coming by the end of this
month, the astronomy club is there to help you to get to know the basics
in multiple areas of astronomy.

Tomorrow, on the 18th, we will be having a lecture at 8:00 pm, in L1 to
discuss several aspects of basic astronomy and astrophysics, not just for
the purposes of people interested in taking part in Takneek, but also for
all those astro enthusiasts who are waiting to learn more!
This will be followed by a discussion on the basics on Astrophotography,
were we'll try to tell you the details of how to capture those amazing
photographs of the sky.
Then, in reference to the 'Sundial Making Competition' at Takneek, we'll
have a short discussion, talking about Sundials, their working, theory and
other basics.

So whether you want to look specifically for Takneek, or even if you just
want to get a better feel of the multiple fields that we work on at the
astronomy club, then be sure to attend.

Venue: L1
Time : 8:00pm

Hope to see you all in large numbers!


May the clear skies be with you!
Cheers,
Coordinators,
Astronomy Club
