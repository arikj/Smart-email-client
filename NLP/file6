Subject:CS671: Regarding the Hindi word-lists
Body: Hi,

Some people have rightly pointed out that some of the words in the 
word-lists that we have given includes some words not found in the 
heliohost Hindi corpus. This is has happened because I was discarding 
non-Indic characters while processing the text and some words which were 
sperated by a hyphen or a slash or other such characters got merged into 
one word.

If you observe that any words present in the list given to you are not 
present in the corpus, you can either fix such words manually or just 
discard them and work only with the remaining words in the list.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks to Prashant and Mohit for 
pointing out the issue.

Regards,
Ram
