Subject:Work to be done : In Language groups- need to meet before Aug 19
Body: 
Dear Class:

We now move to the next phase, where we have to standardize our lists, and
also produce a dictionary of mis-spelled words.

There is a wide variation in the legitimacy of the groundtruths created
by each of you, which may account for some of the variation in P/R
scores.

For testing purposes, your codes will be tested against the groundtruth
morphological parses of thos with the lowest scores.

Meanwhile. we will now work to standardize these.

Below are 10 groupings, eight for Hindi, and one each for Telugu
and Punjabi.

Each group will have to meet once and discuss and standardize
their morphological cuts and a set of spelling errors.

They may also wish to discuss the forthcoming quiz next Wednesday.

For each group, the FIRST PERSON in the list is the convenor, and
the SECOND person is the spell-checker.

It is the Convenor's job to

a) convene a meeting of the group before MONDAY 19 August.  If possible
get another person, a "language expert" who may be from any branch, but
who should know the language well.  You may need to give them a treat !

b) each person must bring 4 copies of printouts of your own morphological
parses used as groundtruths.  (Try to get 2-3 columns
per page).

c) all of you must analyze each others' breakup of the words, and agree
to a consensus.  Note that:
    - all foreign words are excluded from the ground truth
    - words may have two possible legitimate analyses
    - do not try to parse using laws of sandhi or samAsa or pratyay, just
      the parses that are somewhat similar to the root.
    - any word that is in your language, but that you cannot agree upon
       will be separately listed
       with the best parse(s) in a problem-words list.

d) all words that are mis-spelled.  These have to be collected by the
SPELL-CHECKER, who must format them - correct word, followed by
mis-spelling(s) -  and post the file "spell-error-LANGUAGE.txt" on
your page.

e) By Tuesday 20th, the convenor must post the corrected and agreed
upon list "groundtruth-morph.txt", and also the "problems-morph.txt",
on their pages.  We will then
try to combine all of your groundtruth lists.

f) Each language group will have a follow-up meeting next friday during
the class timing and collate their own word lists with others.
Many words (Hindi) appear
in more than one list, and we will try to rationalize these in case
of mismatches.

g) This exercise carries part of the total HOMEWORK GRADE. Those failing
to particpate in the convened meetings will not have their
words evaluated, and will also miss this grade component.

For languages with few users, please consult external experts ASAP.
