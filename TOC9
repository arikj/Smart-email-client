Respected sir,

An other quiz (MSO202A) has been scheduled on the exact time, i.e., 17th August 2013 4-5 pm. We asked the instructor to change the quiz timings but he says since there are 400+ students registered in that course, the DOAA office would be unable to reschedule it because of the large number of rooms it required. And hence, he asked us to ask you to shift the time of the quiz. Sir, could you please reschedule our quiz to some other time?
