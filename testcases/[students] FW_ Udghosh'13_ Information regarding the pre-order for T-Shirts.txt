Hi all,

 

Thank you for your overwhelming response for the pre-order of Udghosh'13
T-Shirts. As for now we'll not be taking any pre-orders for the 'Signature
Edition Navy Blue T-shirt with Chinese Collar' due to the completion of
stock of the same.

 

Also we'll be taking pre-orders for 'White Round neck T-shirt' only for
today, i.e. 19/08/2013.

 

Note: All those of you who have pre-ordered will receive their T-Shirts at
the earliest.

 

Hope to see you soon.

 

Cheers !!

Udghosh'13 Team
