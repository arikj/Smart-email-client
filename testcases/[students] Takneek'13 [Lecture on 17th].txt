Dear Students,

SnT Council is the flag bearer of student endeavors in plethora of
scientific & technical activities. With its roots in the year-long
engagements & opportunities offered by different clubs & hobby groups, we
provide a learning platform for everyone to sharpen their technical
know-how.

In the same spirit, we present to you "TAKNEEK", the Inter Hall technical
festival of IITK.

Through a number of events ranging from Astronomy to Robotics, it will
provide you just the platform to prove your mettle. And as an added perk,
your endeavors might win the coveted ‘Takneek’ trophy for your pool.

We are organizing an interaction session to make you more aware about
Takneek & the different competitions & events being organized under its
banner and how you can participate in them.

Schedule for the Meet:
VENUE: L7
DATE: 17th August
Timings: 6:00 PM-8:00 PM

You can also visit last year’s website to get a glimpse of Takneek.
