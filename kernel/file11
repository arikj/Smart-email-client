Hi David,

As Rajat said, we need to give TAB space before an executable command in
the Makefile. However, here is the simple Makefile, for your reference.

KDIR:=/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build

obj-m:=hello.o

default:
$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules

I hope this helps to you.

Regards,
Srinivas
