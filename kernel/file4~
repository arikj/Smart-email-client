Subject:Re: CS671: Language preference
Body: Hi,

Following is a link to the list of people who have already opted for 
some language.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmcrllbqqprLdHVGaEVudnBMbW5vTXFEUHB2X0djYmc&usp=sharing

The last column in this list is a file name from the following directory:

http://web.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/cs671/2013/resources/corpora/hindi/hindi_word_lists/

Each person who has opted for Hindi will have to use the corresponding 
file for manual segmentation and evaluation. Non-Hindi people will have 
to follow the instructions specified in an earlier mail by Prof. Mukerjee.

People who have not yet filled the form and want to work with a Hindi 
corpus can infer the file name of their evaluation word list from the 
link above once they fill the form.

Regards,
Ram
