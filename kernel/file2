I think it is statically created here
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/irq/irqdesc.c#L243
and the initialization happens in early_irq_init(..) here
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/irq/irqdesc.c#L251.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks.

Hi,
I have been following the prescribed articles and it has been a great help.

I am obviously one step closer to implementing the journaling in file
system. But i didn't et the following things.

What would be the correct sequence of steps in implementing it ? is it
something like this ?
1. At the time of filling super block the journal blocks are initialised.
2. If that is successfull all subsequent operations will be done using
transactions. Which starts using journal_start() and journal_stop().

But thats all i could figure out.  Please help me with this.
