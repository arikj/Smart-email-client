Only for x86.  You're on an ARM or PowerPC or MIPS or any of the other 27
or so architectures we support, it's elsewhere. ;)

Janitors is pretty much deceased, for several reasons:

1) Most of the low-hanging fruit that can be done by somebody who's just
starting out has already been done.  The kernel tree is much cleaner than it
was when the Janitors project started.

2) There's fewer old APIs to clean up, as most subsystem maintainers require
that a patch series that replaces an API also clean up the old one.

3) For many subsystems, the maintainer will give some pushback for style
cleanup patches not part of actual development, for two reasons:  (a) it's
possible for a cleanup patch to break something (for instance, a bad cleanup
of curly brackets can change the control flow).  So they don't like patches
against old stable code that could destabilize it.  (b) If there *is* other
development going on, style cleanups cause merge conflicts (unless they're
done as Step 0 of a development patch, by the guy writing the code, so
all the conflicts are pre-resolved).

A good place to start is to just use git to suck down the current linux-next
tree, build it, run it, and report all problems you encounter. Most code only
gets tested on the 3-4 boxes the code author has access to before it gets into
the linux-next tree. I usually manage to trip over anywhere from 1 to 5 bugs
per kernel release, just because nobody else has actually tried running the
code on a Dell Latitude with the same .config as I have and the same workflow.

If anything, we need a good pool of kernel testers even more than we need more
kernel coders. (And you'll learn a ton that way too - some 95% of what I know
about kernel innards has come from "Oh crud, what did I break *this* time?"
investigation...

One of the things I really miss in the open source kernel world
(coming from the commercial world) is the lack of test packages that
everyone automatically runs, just in case they broke
something. FreeBSD had nothing, AFAICT, with occassional painful
results.  

Does the linux kernel have any kind of regression test package? If so,
where can I find it? If not, does anyone know of ongoing attempts to
create one?

A quick web search gave me a few pointers to attempts at this:

pdf about a regression test framework:
  https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2007/ols2007v2-pages-285-296.pdf
  
A project called crackerjack:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/crackerjack/

A paper from a 2008 linux symposium:

   http://ols.fedoraproject.org/OLS/Reprints-2008/babulal-reprint.pdf

What I don't see is any kind of definitive answer - as in, "just clone
this git repo and build/run it". And the bug reports I see discussed
tend to come from people trying to use linux to accomplish real work. 

So is there something current, live, and useful?

What's the status of "The Linux Driver Project"

http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page

If it's still active, it has a list of devices in need of drivers to be written.

Also, I should add the Kingwin USI-2535U3 USB3 / Sata adapter I bought
a few months ago.
