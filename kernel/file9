Actually, in case of any interrupt, be it timer or I/O or NMI or whatever.

And there's no actual guarantee that when the process gets rescheduled, that
you'll return to the same core you were on.

Pretty much anytime the scheduler comes to that decision. :)

Hi Valdis,

Understood.

So, essentially a scheduler can kick in while returning from ANY sort of interrupt (and not just timer interrupt), right?

Thanks,

Rajat

Uh, are we saying that once a process (say running on core-0) has entered preemptible kernel , there is a chance that suddenly the scheduler might decide it to move to core-1? I though preemptible only means that a process can only be preempted (not moved to another core) under following situations:

1) An interrupt happens (In case of timer, it could put the process back in queue if its time slice expired).
2) The process goes to sleep (can be a result of a call that can sleep).

Can some one shed light on what conditions would a running process be moved to another core?

Thanks,

rajat

Hi,

I am sorry if this has been asked before, I tried to look around but did
not get an solution and hence the mail.

In this mail from Mel Gorman:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/15/362

He mentions a set of patches:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/15/292

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/15/383

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/15/322

Could someone please teach me

1) how do I find out where is the tree he is working on (i.e. is he working
on linux-next or ... )
2) Where do I find these patches mentioned ? Currently I cut copy paste in
a vim manually and its really frustrating, could some one please point out
the right way of pulling these patches. via git ?

Thanks a lot for your time in advance.
