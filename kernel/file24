Hello all,

I am not sure this newsletter is the right place to post that kind question then excuse me in advance is I am wrong and suggest me a good place where do that.

I am trying to perform a simple but a little tricky task: I have to understand the maximum payload size of an UDP packet in order to avoid fragmentation of that.

Some suggestions ?

P.
