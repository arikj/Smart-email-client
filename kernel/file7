Hello,

I've been able to figure out from all the various HOWTOs about the 
different kernel trees (main development, -next, -stable, the subsystem 
trees, etc.) and I see where the files and patches are archived on 
kernel.org, but I haven't been able to find the actual git repos that I 
need to clone to work on the main kernel, or any of the others. Can 
someone please elaborate on exactly where each of these are stored so 
that I can more easily translate this conceptual knowledge into the 
actual git commands I have to run to make it work?

Thanks,
Dolan

Hi Dolan,

Check cgit interface on kernel.org.

For example linux-next is at
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?id=refs/tags/next-20130729

thanks,
Daniel.

Hello!

It depends on what you are looking for. There is the gitweb interface
[1] for the kernel.org repos. You'll find the repos there. Git, by
definition, is distributed, to there isn't 'the one true repo'. The de
facto official repo, I think is considered Linus's linux.git [2]
(there is also a mirror on github [3], but don't try to send pull
requests :P on github for the Linux kernel). So if you want a stable
repo, maybe that is what you should clone.

For a little more unstable version, there's the linux-next repo (I
think the address is this [4]). It's there new features are being
introduced first, ,before the mainline version. But most subsystems
(and chief maintainers) have their own tree (like David's net repo
[5]).

If you want to start general patching, linux-next should be a good
start. But if there is a specific subsystem you are interested in, get
its own repo.

Thanks a lot
Juliet
